### Mode C Veil:  
_No use on VATSIM;_ Magenta circle, thin line, very big, area in which you need transponder. In VATSIM you'd better use transponder always.  

* Class B:  
Blue thick lines. Inverted cake shape. The lower you go, the closer you can get to the airport without talking to app controller.  
"Cleared to Class Bravo airspace" statement needed to enter when VFR.  

* Class C:  
Magenta thick lines. Inverted cake shape. 
Permission: If intending to enter C airspace, there is a magenta square indicating how far you need to contact controller declaring intentions (not just right when you are about to enter, but usually from further). No need to contact within that distance if you are not to enter the Class C.  

* Class D:  
Blue dotted line. 4 miles out. No cake shaped, just a cylinder and a number indicating altitude MSL of the airspace.  
Permission: Only 2 way radio
