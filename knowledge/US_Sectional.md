#### Mode C Veil:  
_No use on VATSIM;_ Magenta circle, thin line, very big, area in which you need transponder. In VATSIM you'd better use transponder always.  

---
#### Class B:  
Blue thick lines. Inverted cake shape. The lower you go, the closer you can get to the airport without talking to app controller.  
"Cleared to Class Bravo airspace" statement needed to enter when VFR.  

---
#### Class C:  
Magenta thick lines. Inverted cake shape. 
Permission: "Cleared to Class C" statement needed. If intending to enter C airspace, there is a magenta square indicating how far you need to contact controller declaring intentions (not just right when you are about to enter, but usually from further). No need to contact within that distance if you are not to enter the Class C.  

---
#### Class D:  
Blue dotted line. 4 miles out. No cake shaped, just a cylinder and a number indicating altitude MSL of the airspace.  
Permission: Only 2 way radio. If they say your callsign, you can enter.

---
#### Uncontrolled E and G:  
E is from 1200 ft above.  In magenta shaded, it's from 700 ft. In magenta dotted, it's from SFC  
G is from 'Ground' SFC up to E.  

No relevant difference in VFR. Just subtle differences in minimums etc.  

---
#### Airports:  
Blue: Towered  
Magenta: Non-towered  

ATIS, AWOS, CT (ctrl tower): not relevant -> Provided by controller in VATSIM (disregard sectional info)  
Cursive Number followed by star -> Field elev.  
Two digit number -> Lenght of the rwy in ft.  
Frequency followed by rounded C: CTAF.  
RP 6 -> Right pattern RWY 6 (when it shows like this)

---
#### Restricted/Prohibited:  
Blue spiked line.  Named like R-xxxxxxxx or P-xxxxxxxxxxxx  
You can review in the sectional descriptions about restriction hours etc.

---
#### MOA/ALERT (Military/Alert):  
Red spiked lines.  
Military ops not simulated in VATSIM. In RL you are encouraged to be in comms with ATC (usually Center or App) for flight following.

---
#### Special use airspace:  
Blue boxed line or shaded in white.  
White surface. Only seldom simulated in VATSIM, review sectional info about it.
