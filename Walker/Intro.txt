It is important to know that you will never use the flight number given to you when you bid. We require you to use your pilot ID number listed below:

 

Your call-sign (flight number) on network is:
WAT3093

Your verbal would be (depending on region):
WAL-KER THIRTY NINETY-THREE
WAL-KER THREE ZERO NINE THREE

 

You DO NOT use the flight number issued when bidding your flight; example: WAX1775, WAE120, WAC1442, etc.

If you fail to follow this rule you will be removed from the airline.
