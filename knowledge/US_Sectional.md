* Mode C Veil:  
No use on VATSIM; Magenta circle, thin line, very big, area in which you need transponder. In VATSIM you'd better use transponder always.  

* Class B:  
Thick blue lines. Inverted cake shape. The lower you go, the closer you can get to the airport without talking to app controller.
